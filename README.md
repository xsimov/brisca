## Developing

This is a traditional card game I used to play with my friends before they went abroad. Now I'm replicating it so we can keep playing through Internet.

* The game has 2-4 players. 
1. Each player draws 3 cards at the beginning of the game.
2. At the beginning a card is put aside face up, and that is the **ruling suite of the game**.
3. The first round starting player is the player next to the one who shuffled the deck.
* In the other rounds the starting player is the one that won the last round, the game is usually played clockwise, but you may discuss several hours to decide wether clockwise or counter-.
4. ROUND
  1. The first player chooses its card and plays it. **That card’s suite** will be the ruling suite for *that round*. 
  2. The other players play in the discussed order.
  * If the other players cards’ suites are different from the first suite _and_ different from the game-ruling suite, the first player wins.
  * If one of the other players plays a game-ruling-suite card, that player wins the round.
  * In case the players are tied with the suites then the numerical order counts as follows: (from stronger to weaker)
  * **1, 3, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2**
  3. The player that won the round takes the cards involved and puts them down-faced in front of him, waiting for the end of the game.
  4. The player that won becomes the first player, and cards must be drawn in order.
* Some other special rules:
  * When the game ruling suite is not a 2, it can be substituted by the 2 of that suite _only_ if the player **just** won a round.
  * Again... **1, 3, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2**
  * The first card put aside is the last to be drawn.
* Scoring rules:
  * At the end of a game 4 points are assigned:
    1. One point for the player that has more cards.
    2. One point for the player that has more coins cards.
    3. One point for the player that has more sevens.
    4. One point for the player that has the coins seven.

If anything of this sounds weird to you it may be because my family invented this rules at certain point. But we have played it this way for a long long time, so... this is our brisca.

Enjoy it and contribute!
